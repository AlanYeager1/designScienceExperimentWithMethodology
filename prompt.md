Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this idea. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed specification I can hand off to a developer. Letâ€™s do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. Remember, only one question at a time.

The detailed description of the project you have to build is in `requirement.md`. 


Before exploring the actual task and code generation, use methodology.md to build a shared vocabulary system based on the requirements above and use it to streamline your development process."
